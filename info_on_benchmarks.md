Certainly! I'll go through the results and provide commentary on each model's performance across different datasets. Here's an analysis of the results:
SU-BitNet b1.58 Large (185.37M parameters):
a) On enwik8:
Good perplexity (13.89) and BPC (0.47), indicating strong compression ability.
High compression ratio (16.86), showing efficient data representation.
Low next character prediction accuracy (0.04), suggesting room for improvement in exact predictions.
b) On enwik9:
Slightly worse perplexity (17.40) and BPC (0.52) compared to enwik8, which is expected for a larger dataset.
Still maintains a good compression ratio (15.53).
Improved next character prediction accuracy (0.06), possibly due to more diverse training data.
c) On wikitext-2 and wikitext-103:
Perplexity, BPC, and compression ratio are skipped, likely due to dataset format differences.
Higher next character prediction accuracy (0.12), suggesting better performance on more structured text.
SU-BitNet b1.58 Small (22.35M parameters):
a) On enwik8:
Surprisingly good perplexity (11.76) and BPC (0.44), even better than the large model.
Excellent compression ratio (18.00), outperforming the large model.
Lower next character prediction accuracy (0.03), indicating a trade-off between compression and exact predictions.
b) On enwik9:
Slightly worse perplexity (13.36) and BPC (0.47) compared to enwik8, but still very good.
Maintains a high compression ratio (17.11).
Improved next character prediction accuracy (0.05), similar to the large model's trend.
c) On wikitext-2 and wikitext-103:
Perplexity, BPC, and compression ratio are skipped.
Significantly higher next character prediction accuracy (0.15), outperforming the large model on structured text.
General observations:
The small model performs surprisingly well, often matching or outperforming the large model in terms of perplexity and compression ratio. This suggests that the architecture is efficient and scales well.
Both models show better next character prediction accuracy on wikitext datasets, indicating they perform better on more structured, natural language text compared to the more diverse enwik datasets.
The models generally show lower accuracy in text continuation tasks compared to next character prediction, which is expected as it's a more challenging task.
The large model uses more memory and has higher latency, as expected, but the difference is not proportional to the parameter count difference. This suggests good efficiency in the larger model.
Both models show relatively low next character prediction accuracies, but this is not uncommon for character-level models on diverse datasets. The average target character probabilities provide a more nuanced view of performance.
The compression ratios achieved by both models are impressive, especially for the small model, indicating that the BitNet architecture is very efficient at capturing and representing information.
In conclusion, these results suggest that the BitNet architecture is highly efficient, with the smaller model showing surprisingly strong performance. The models excel in compression tasks but have room for improvement in exact character prediction. They perform better on more structured text (wikitext) compared to more diverse datasets (enwik). The strong performance of the small model suggests that this architecture could be particularly useful in resource-constrained environments.
